# Azgaar Map
This is a common type library for representing an Azgaar World in a 3d-friendly structure.
The types described in this library are shared by both the Azgaar Map Parser (which is able to parse worlds
created using the Azgaar tool)and the Mono Azgaar viewer (which is able to render very large worlds).

## Dependencies
The following third party projects are used (thanks for all heroes involved):
- [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) for definition of all core and base types.
